 #Project Summary

 The InstaNews tasked us with developing a news app that called the top 12 New York Times stories from the section selected by
 the user. The project focused on building upon a foundation of Sass folders, emphasizing JavaScript and teaching us how to
 properly display data using a mixture of API's, Ajax, and JSON objects.

 #Technologies Used
 
 Sass, JSON, AJAX, API's, jQuery, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Git/GitHub, Terminal/Command Line

 #Personal Learning

 The major learning of this project involves Javascript. By the end of this project I was able to build my own personal
 functions, manipulating them to tailor to my needs. An example of this is the error message. To create a functioning error
 message I had to create a function that not only displayed the message, but also kept the initial header display. Instead of 
 switching to the withArticles display.
 
 Secondary learnings, yet not minor, included Sass, Ajax, API's, and JSON. We used Sass for sorting our style.css file into 
 individual building blocks to optimize our code and improve overall organization. This was done by creating those building
 blocks into .scss files and then calling those files in our style.css. Furthermore, we introduced mixins and variables 
 through Sass. Mixins were incredibly helpful with regards to media queries.
 
 As aforementioned we also learned about API's, JSON, and Ajax. To be perfectly honest this project was not enough for me to 
 fully understand how they interact with each other, and exactly what roles they play in that relationship. If I did give a
 definition right now it would be str8 from Google.

#Improvements

I was really proud of this project. My literacy in JS improved greatly and I am quite confident and ready for the next project.
One improvement I would make is further utilizing the organization that Sass brings to our code.
